# react llm design update - final

## hard left alignment achieved

### layout changes:
- container now has `margin-left: 120px` instead of centered margin
- max-width reduced to 768px (from 1200px) for tighter content column
- navigation also left-aligned with 120px padding
- responsive breakpoints maintain alignment on smaller screens

### subtle design enhancements:

1. **summary line**
   - added uppercase summary at top with key features
   - separated by subtle border
   - uses bullet separators (•) for visual rhythm

2. **featured section (quick start)**
   - subtle background with hover color
   - left border accent in focused color
   - contained padding for emphasis
   - stands out without being loud

3. **typography refinements**
   - h2: smaller (1.5rem), with subtle underline accent
   - h3: uppercase with letter-spacing and muted color
   - added ⊹ symbol to h3 elements for visual interest
   - consistent monospace throughout

4. **interactive elements**
   - action list items now have subtle hover backgrounds
   - 200ms transitions for smooth interactions
   - icon color changes on hover for visual feedback
   - navigation links uppercase with hover states

5. **code blocks**
   - very subtle background
   - subdued border with left accent
   - increased padding for breathing room
   - maintains readability

## key principles applied:

- **character-based measurements**: using ch units where appropriate
- **subtle transitions**: 200ms ease throughout
- **hover states**: background changes, not just color
- **uppercase accents**: strategic use for hierarchy
- **left-aligned structure**: strong vertical alignment at 120px
- **monochrome base**: minimal color, maximum impact

the page now has the hard left alignment of physical intelligence while incorporating subtle design elements that make it pop without being flashy. every element feels intentional and precisely placed.
