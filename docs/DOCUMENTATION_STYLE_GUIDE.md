# react llm documentation style guide

## core principles

1. **engineering truth over marketing language**
   - say what it does, not how amazing it is
   - focus on technical facts
   - avoid superlatives

2. **constraints breed creativity**
   - define what we don't do
   - explain why we chose specific limitations
   - celebrate focus over features

3. **democratic design**
   - remove friction and jargon
   - make it approachable to all developers
   - prioritize clarity over cleverness

4. **lowercase throughout**
   - all text in lowercase
   - including headings and navigation
   - creates visual consistency

## language guidelines

### use
- simple, direct sentences
- technical accuracy
- concrete examples
- engineering terminology when precise

### avoid
- marketing speak ("transform", "revolutionary", "seamless")
- emojis and decorative elements
- centered text or badges
- growth metrics (stars, downloads)
- feature lists without depth

- [ ] no marketing language
- [ ] constraints are clearly defined
- [ ] examples are minimal and clear
- [ ] technical accuracy verified
- [ ] no unnecessary adjectives
- [ ] focused on one clear purpose

## philosophy

every piece of documentation should make react llm more approachable and honest. we're not selling anything. we're sharing a tool that does one thing well: it makes react components conversational.

the best documentation helps developers understand quickly and get back to building.
