# React LLM - Final Review & Cohesiveness Check

## Vision Alignment ✅

All documentation files are now aligned with the core vision:
- **Browser-native AI coding assistant** (not just a debugging tool)
- **Multi-model LLM support** via OpenRouter
- **Visual component selection** with bippy
- **Two distinct modes**: Development (live editing) and Production (exploration)

## Technical Stack Consistency ✅

### Core Dependencies (Verified across all docs)
1. **LLM Integration**: OpenRouter SDK with dynamic model fetching
2. **React Instrumentation**: bippy library
3. **UI Framework**: Preact + Signals
4. **File System**: OPFS + File System Access API
5. **Database**: SQLite WASM with OPFS
6. **Build Tool**: tsup with worker inlining

### Model Support (Dynamic Fetching)
All models are fetched dynamically from provider APIs:
- **OpenRouter**: `/api/v1/models` endpoint (aggregates all providers)
- **OpenAI**: `/v1/models` endpoint  
- **Anthropic**: `/v1/models` endpoint
- **Google**: `/v1/models` endpoint

No hardcoded model versions - users always see the latest available models.

## Agent Task Alignment ✅

### Agent 1 (Marketing) - Updated ✅
- Hero copy: "Chat with your code, right in the browser"
- Live demo with model selection
- Documentation includes provider setup guides
- Feature grid showcases multi-model AI

### Agent 2 (Core) - Updated ✅
- OpenRouter client with model caching
- Dynamic model fetching from `/models` endpoint
- Enhanced model selector with search and recommendations
- Component selection via bippy
- File System Access for live editing

### Agent 3 (Launch) - Updated ✅
- README showcases multi-model support
- API docs include provider configuration
- Distribution supports all provider API keys
- Analytics tracks model usage

## Key Features Consistency ✅

Across all documents:
1. **Visual Component Selection** - Click to select any React component
2. **Multi-Model Chat** - Switch between AI models on the fly
3. **Live Code Editing** - Dev mode with File System Access API
4. **Component Library** - Save patterns with OPFS
5. **Zero Config** - Single script tag installation

## API Consistency ✅

### Initialization Pattern (Consistent everywhere)
```javascript
ReactLLM.init({
  providers: {
    openrouter: 'sk-or-...',  // Recommended: access all models
    // Or individual providers:
    openai: 'sk-...',         // Optional
    anthropic: 'sk-ant-...'   // Optional
  },
  mode: 'development' // or 'production'
  // Model selection happens after init via UI
})
```

## Distribution Channels ✅

All agents reference the same channels:
1. **Script Tag**: `<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-llm/dist/react-llm.js">`
2. **NPM**: `npm install react-llm`
3. **Dev Plugins**: Vite/Next.js auto-injection
4. **Browser Extension**: Enhanced permissions
5. **Bookmarklet**: One-click activation

## Timeline Consistency ✅

All documents follow the same 4-week plan:
- **Week 1**: OpenRouter migration, bippy integration
- **Week 2**: File System Access, component context
- **Week 3**: Component library, production features
- **Week 4**: Launch preparation

## Branding Consistency ✅

- **Name**: React LLM (consistent)
- **Tagline**: "Browser-native AI coding assistant"
- **Description**: Focuses on chat + code, not debugging
- **Keywords**: Include ai, LLM, gpt-4, claude, code-assistant

## Technical Implementation Details ✅

### Model Fetching Strategy
- Fetch models dynamically from provider APIs on initialization
- Cache models for 1 hour in localStorage to reduce API calls
- Group by provider for easier filtering
- Sort by capabilities (context length, features)
- No hardcoded defaults - user selects from available models

### Component Selection Flow
1. User clicks component
2. bippy identifies fiber node
3. Canvas overlay highlights
4. Context extracted for AI
5. Component added to chat context

### File Editing Flow (Dev Mode)
1. AI generates code changes
2. Diff shown to user
3. User approves changes
4. File System Access API writes files
5. HMR updates browser instantly

## Ready for Claude Code Instances ✅

All three agent documents:
- Have clear, focused missions
- Include detailed implementation examples
- Reference the shared vision
- Use consistent APIs and patterns
- Support the latest AI models

## Recommendations for Launch

1. **Prioritize OpenRouter Integration** - This enables all other AI features
2. **Test Model Fetching** - Ensure we always have latest models
3. **Focus on DX** - Zero-config experience is critical
4. **Document Provider Setup** - Clear guides for each API key
5. **Demo Everything** - Live examples sell the product

## Final Notes

The documentation is now fully aligned with the vision of React LLM as a browser-native AI coding assistant that:
- Works on any website
- Supports all major LLM providers
- Enables visual component selection
- Allows live code editing in development
- Provides component exploration in production

All agent tasks are ready to be executed in parallel with Sonnet 4.
