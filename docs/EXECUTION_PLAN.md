# React LLM Execution Plan

## Overview

This execution plan outlines the path from our current monorepo state to a production-ready React LLM release. Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, we have identified 4 critical agents that can work in parallel to deliver the vision outlined in our documentation.

## Current State Summary

### âœ… Foundation Complete (60%)
- **Monorepo Structure**: Proper packages and apps organization
- **Marketing Website**: Next.js 15 site with hero, features, and components
- **Core Package Scaffold**: TypeScript, tsup build, basic architecture
- **Framework Plugins**: Next.js and Vite plugin scaffolds
- **Planning Documentation**: Comprehensive vision and technical specs

### ðŸ”„ Critical Gaps (40%)
- **Core Functionality**: OpenRouter integration, component selection, file system APIs
- **Documentation Site**: Completely empty `apps/docs` directory
- **Testing & CI/CD**: No automated testing or deployment pipelines
- **Live Demo**: Marketing hero demo needs functional React LLM

## Agent Assignment Strategy

Based on the analysis, we can achieve maximum parallel execution with 4 specialized agents:

### **Agent 4: Core Library Integration** (`/core/`)
**Owner**: Core development specialist
**Timeline**: 4 weeks

**Week 1**: OpenRouter client and model selection UI
**Week 2**: Component selection with React fiber traversal  
**Week 3**: File system APIs and live code editing
**Week 4**: Testing and performance optimization

### **Agent 6: CI/CD & Testing** (`/launch/`)
**Owner**: DevOps/Infrastructure specialist  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks
**Dependencies**: Can start immediately, coordinates with all agents

**Mission**: Establish testing framework, CI/CD pipelines, and automated release processes.

**Week 1**: Testing foundation (Vitest, Playwright)
**Week 2**: GitHub Actions workflows
**Week 3**: Integration and E2E testing
**Week 4**: Quality gates and monitoring

### **Agent 8: Documentation Site** (`/marketing/`)

**Mission**: Build complete documentation site with Fumadocs, API docs, guides, and interactive examples.

**Week 1**: Fumadocs setup and core documentation
**Week 2**: Feature documentation and interactive demos
**Week 3**: Advanced guides and troubleshooting
**Week 4**: Search integration and SEO optimization

### **Agent 9: Live Demo Integration** (`/marketing/`)
**Owner**: Frontend specialist (can coordinate with Agent 8)
**Timeline**: 4 weeks
**Dependencies**: Agent 4 for functional React LLM

**Mission**: Complete marketing website with functional React LLM demo showcasing real component selection and AI interactions.

**Week 1**: Demo components and simulation layer
**Week 2**: React LLM integration and API connection
**Week 3**: Interactive features and real-time updates
**Week 4**: Polish, analytics, and mobile support

## Coordination Strategy

### Week 1: Foundation Sprint
All agents can start immediately with minimal coordination:

- **Agent 4**: Focus on OpenRouter integration (no external dependencies)
- **Agent 6**: Set up testing framework and basic CI (benefits all agents)
- **Agent 8**: Initialize Fumadocs and write installation guides
- **Agent 9**: Create demo components and simulation layer

### Week 2-3: Integration Phase
Agents begin coordinating as core functionality becomes available:

- **Agent 4 â†’ Agent 9**: Share development builds for demo integration
- **Agent 4 â†’ Agent 8**: Provide API surface for documentation
- **Agent 6**: Add tests for Agent 4's implementations
- **Agent 8 â†” Agent 9**: Coordinate marketing messaging

### Week 4: Launch Preparation
All agents focus on polish and release preparation:

- **Agent 4**: Performance optimization and final testing
- **Agent 6**: Release automation and deployment pipelines
- **Agent 8**: SEO optimization and content review
- **Agent 9**: Analytics integration and conversion optimization

## Technical Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Agent 4 â†’ Agent 9**: Live demo needs functional React LLM
2. **Agent 4 â†’ Agent 8**: API documentation needs stable API surface
3. **Agent 6 â†’ All**: CI/CD enables quality assurance for all agents

### Parallel Work Streams
- **Agent 6 + Agent 8**: Can work completely in parallel
- **Agent 8 + Agent 9**: Marketing coordination but separate codebases
- **Agent 4**: Can work independently until Week 3 integration

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups (Async)
Each agent posts updates in shared channel:
- **Progress**: What was completed yesterday
- **Blockers**: Any dependencies or issues
- **Next**: What's planned for today
- **Coordination**: Any needs from other agents

### Weekly Integration Reviews
Synchronous meeting to coordinate dependencies:
- **Demo Integration**: Agent 4 shares builds with Agent 9
- **API Documentation**: Agent 4 reviews docs from Agent 8
- **Quality Gates**: Agent 6 reports on test coverage and CI health
- **Launch Planning**: All agents align on release timeline

### Ad-hoc Coordination
Direct communication channels for urgent coordination:
- **Agent 4 â†” Agent 9**: React LLM integration questions
- **Agent 4 â†” Agent 8**: API documentation clarifications
- **Agent 6 â†” All**: CI/CD and testing support

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **OpenRouter API Changes**: Agent 4 implements robust error handling
- **Browser Compatibility**: Agent 4 includes fallbacks for all modern APIs
- **Performance Issues**: Agent 6 includes performance monitoring
- **Security Concerns**: Agent 6 implements security scanning

### Timeline Risks
- **Agent Dependencies**: Each agent has fallback plans for delayed dependencies
- **Scope Creep**: Clearly defined success criteria prevent feature expansion
- **Integration Issues**: Weekly reviews catch integration problems early
- **Resource Constraints**: Agent workload is balanced and realistic

### Quality Risks
- **Testing Coverage**: Agent 6 enforces coverage requirements
- **Documentation Quality**: Agent 8 includes user testing and feedback
- **User Experience**: Agent 9 includes analytics to measure demo effectiveness
- **Production Readiness**: All agents coordinate on launch checklist
