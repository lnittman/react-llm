## 📊 Current Project Status

### What's Working
- **Marketing Website** (`apps/web`): Hero section with placeholder demo

- **OpenRouter Integration**: Full multi-model support implemented
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Complete testing and release automation
- **Documentation Site**: Foundation built, content created
- **Live Demo**: Fully interactive with simulation mode

### Known Issues
1. **Docs Site Build Errors**:
   - `items is not iterable` error in DocsLayout
   - Tailwind CSS `@layer utilities` directive missing
   - Needs Tailwind v4 alignment with web app

2. **Integration Pending**:
   - React fiber traversal for component selection
   - OPFS and File System Access APIs
